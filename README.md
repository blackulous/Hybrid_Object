# Hybrid Object
## Technologies Used
AutoDesk Maya: Used for all aspects of the project including texturing, modeling and lighting.
## Brief Description
The objective of this project was to combine two objects into one but with a creative twist to it. I decided ultimately to go with a banana and an old-school telephone because of the complexity of the modeling. 
## Learnings
This project allowed me to learn new components of the modeling process such as adding a background and merging objects together. 
It also allowed me to practice being extremely detailed orientated as that is the only way this project would be able to come out how I envisioned it.
